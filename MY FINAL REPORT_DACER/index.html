This experience has been a significant chapter in my journey of growth—both professionally and personally.<br>
                Thank you to my supervisor for the guidance, patience, and constructive feedback that helped shape my skills and mindset. I also want to extend my thanks to my co-interns and the entire SLI team for their support and collaboration, which made every day a rewarding learning experience.<br>
